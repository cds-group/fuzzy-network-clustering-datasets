The dataset consists of 140 unweighted undirected networks. 

Each network represents a country: its nodes are 21 variables related to sustainability, climate change, economic indicators and production 
(downloaded from the FAOSTAT database).
An edge between any two variables (nodes) means that the corresponding variables are highly (positively or negatively) correlated.

The networks have been generated as follows: 
- For each contry, consider 21 time series of the variables from 1990 to 2019. 
- Detrend the time series to avoid autocorrelation.
- Compute correlation matrix for each country. 
- Tranform each correlation matrix into an adjacency matrix: whenever the correlation between two variables,
 in its absolute value, is higher than a threshold (0.7), then an edge will link the two nodes. 
 So the generic element a_{ij} is 1 if variables i and j are highly correlated, 0 otherwise.

The variables taken into account are:
- CH4_LULUCF: total emissions of methane (CH4), measured in kilotonnes, from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. 
- CH4_AFOLU:  total emissions of methane (CH4), measured in kilotonnes, from Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use.
- CH4_Emission on agricultural land: total emissions of methane (CH4), measured in kilotonnes, from Agriculture.
- CH4_Farm-gate emissions: Farm-gate total emissions of methane (CH4), measured in kilotonnes.
- CH4_Land Use change: total emissions of methane (CH4), measured in kilotonnes, from Land use change.
